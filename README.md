# Student Performance Factors

This project explores the factors influencing student performance based on a dataset of various indicators. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`Student_Performance_Factors.ipynb`), focusing on data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

The main objective is to analyze a dataset of student performance and determine which factors most significantly impact academic outcomes. The notebook covers:

- **Data Loading:** A dataset is loaded from a CSV file containing student information.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into the structure and summary statistics of the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Preprocessing steps including encoding and scaling.
- **Modeling:** Building regression models to predict student performance based on various factors.


## Dataset

The dataset includes various factors like:

- **Demographics:** Information about the students' background.
- **Study Habits:** Details regarding study patterns and parental involvement.
- **Grades and Scores:** Academic performance metrics.

The dataset is loaded into the notebook and is then explored with various summary statistics and visualizations to gain insights into potential patterns.

## Models

The notebook uses several machine learning models, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

These models are used to predict student performance, and their effectiveness is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score**.

## Results

Key findings include:

- Specific study habits and parental involvement significantly affect student performance.
- The models show varying degrees of accuracy, with [Ridge] performing the best.
